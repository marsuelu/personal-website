## about javascript

### JS Engine

* compile Javascript to machine code.
* chrome/Microsoft Edge/Node.js V8
* Firefox SpiderMonkey
* JITï¼šJust-In-Time Compilation,compile frequently used code at runtime for faster execution.
* how things store in browser:
     <1> stack:keep primitive types,like string,number,boolean,null,undefined
     <2> heap: keep referemce types,function,object,array
* the order of render:
    <1> HTML is parsed from top to bottom,when  a <script> is encountered, parsing pauses until the script is executed, unless the script has 'async' or 'defer'.
    <2> The browser generates the DOM, CSSOM, and executes JavaScript. If a script depends on CSS, it waits for CSSOM to finish before executing.
* stack overflow:callstack keeps track of the function execution.The functions are like a pile of plates.Each function call is added to the call stack (like stacking plates). When a function returns, it is removed from the stack. If recursion never ends, the stack grows until it overflows.
